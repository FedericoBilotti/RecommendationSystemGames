## ðŸ”§ Environment Variables & ðŸš€ Run with Docker Compose

Before starting the application with Docker Compose, create a file named `.env` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml`, containing:

```dotenv
# JWT settings
TOKEN_KEY=YourSecretKey
ISSUER=YourIssuer
AUDIENCE=YourAudience
EXPIRES_IN_MINUTES=30

# PostgreSQL settings
USER_DATABASE=Host=postgres-recom-db;Port=5432;Database=your_db;Username=your_user;Password=your_password
POSTGRES_USER=your_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_DB=your_db

# .NET environment
DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Development
```

Then, simply execute `docker compose up --build`

This will:

- Read your environment variables from .env.
- Build the API image.
- Start both the API and the Postgres database containers.
